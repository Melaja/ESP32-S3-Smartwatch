Arduino IDE Settings for Waveshare Smart Watch ESP32S3 Touch AMOLED 2.06"
In the IDE go to Tools/ Board/ ESP32 Arduino/ ESP32S3 Dev Module and configure:



Setting                         Value / Note
Board:                          ESP32S3 Dev Module
USB CDC On Boot:                Enabled (otherwise no serial monitor)
USB DFU On Boot:                Disabled
Serial Port:                    COM12
Flash Size:                     16 MB (depending on your Waveshare variant, usually 16 MB)
PSRAM:                          OPI PSRAM
Upload Speed:                   115200 or 921600 (start with 115200, faster can be used later)
CPU Frequency:                  240 MHz
Flash Mode:                     QIO
Partition Scheme:               Default 16MB with spiffs (or "Huge APP" if you have a lot of LVGL code)
Arduino Runs On:                Core 1
Events Run On:                  Core 1
USB Mode:                       Hardware CDC and JTAG
Baudrate Monitor:               115200


Extra tips:
* Set USB CDC On Boot = Enabled, otherwise you will not see Serial.println() messages.
* Set PSRAM = Disabled, otherwise you may get memory allocation errors.
* Make sure the correct COM port is selected (after upload a second CDC port often appears).
* If uploading fails: briefly press the BOOT button while starting the upload.
