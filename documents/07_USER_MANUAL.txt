================================================================================
  Version:    2.3.1
  Date:       1 February 2026
  Author:     JWP van Renen
================================================================================


1. FIRST USE
================================================================================

After uploading the firmware:

  1. The display briefly shows a welcome screen
  2. The clock appears as the first screen
  3. If WiFi is configured, the time is automatically
     synchronized via the internet (NTP)
  4. The smartwatch is now ready for use


2. SWITCHING SCREENS
================================================================================

The smartwatch has 4 screens. Switch with horizontal swipes:

  SWIPE LEFT  -->  Next screen
  SWIPE RIGHT <--  Previous screen

  Order: Clock -> Steps -> Settings -> Files -> Clock ...

  Tips:
  - Swipe at least 50 pixels
  - Swipe more horizontally than vertically
  - The screens slide with a smooth animation (300ms)


3. SCREEN 1: CLOCK
================================================================================

  Display:
  ---------
  - Large digital time: e.g. "14:35"
  - Seconds separate: e.g. "22"
  - Date: e.g. "31 Januari 2026"
  - Day name: e.g. "Vrijdag" (Dutch)

  Time synchronization:
  - Time is automatically retrieved via WiFi (NTP)
  - Timezone: Europe/Brussels (automatic DST switching)
  - Without WiFi: time starts at 00:00 and runs from boot

  Actions: No special actions on this screen.
  Swipe left/right to switch screens.


4. SCREEN 2: STEP COUNTER
================================================================================

  Display:
  ---------
  - Title: "Stappen" (Steps)
  - Step count: e.g. "1,234"
  - Status: "Actief" (Active) or "Gepauzeerd" (Paused)

  Actions:
  -------
  - SHORT TAP:     Pause or resume step counting
  - LONG PRESS:    Reset step counter to 0 (>1 second)

  How it works:
  The built-in accelerometer (QMI8658) detects walking movements.
  The algorithm analyzes the acceleration force and recognizes the
  pattern of steps (peaks and valleys in the data).


5. SCREEN 3: SETTINGS
================================================================================

  Display:
  ---------
  - Brightness slider (0-255)
  - Battery percentage with color coding
  - WiFi status

  Brightness:
  -----------
  Drag the slider left (darker) or right (brighter).
  The brightness is adjusted immediately.

  Battery color codes:
  - GREEN:  > 50% - Well charged
  - YELLOW: 20-50% - Moderate, consider charging
  - RED:    < 20% - Almost empty, charging recommended

  WiFi status:
  - "Verbonden" (Connected, blue) = WiFi active, time sync works
  - "Geen" (None, red) = No WiFi connection

  - Screen completely off (0/255)
  - Updates paused
  - Tap the screen to wake

  On every touch the display immediately returns to
  full brightness.


11. PREPARING THE SD CARD
================================================================================

  Format: FAT32

  Recommended folder structure:
  /
  |-- images/
  |   |-- BG_Watch_Audio.png        (REQUIRED for audio player)
  |   |-- button_play_75.png        (REQUIRED for audio player)
  |   |-- button_pause_75.png       (REQUIRED for audio player)
  |   |-- button_prev_75.png        (REQUIRED for audio player)
  |   |-- button_next_75.png        (REQUIRED for audio player)
  |   |-- button_repeat_75.png      (REQUIRED for audio player)
  |
  |-- music/                         (your own audio files)
  |   |-- song1.mp3
  |   |-- song2.wav
  |
  |-- photos/                        (your own images)
  |   |-- vacation.jpg
  |   |-- portrait.png

  IMPORTANT: The /images/ folder with audio player files is
  REQUIRED for the audio player. Without these files, simple
  colored circles are shown as buttons (fallback).


12. TIPS AND TRICKS
================================================================================

  - The file browser sorts files in FAT32 filesystem order
    (usually order of creation).

  - Large JPEG files are automatically scaled to fit the
    screen (1:1, 1:2, 1:4 or 1:8).

  - Progressive JPEG files are NOT supported.
    Convert them to Baseline JPEG (open in Paint and save
    again as JPEG).

  - The audio player does not auto-advance to the next file.
    After a song ends, playback stops. Use the >> button or
    the repeat button.

  - WiFi is only needed for time synchronization. All other
    functions (files, audio, steps) work without WiFi.

  - The display wakes immediately on touch, even from the
    deepest sleep state.
